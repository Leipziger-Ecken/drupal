# README

!!! Important information for users of this module:

Additional features are not intended to be added to the widgets.

The project is designed in a way that when you install this module, you should 
create your own widget. Start by copying the code from any one of the widgets
into your own module, add and remove features as you require, while ensuring a 
unique widget ID in its annotation. 

The widgets provided by this module are designed to be examples of how to create
a Recurring Dates Field widget.

If helpers can be extracted so that other widgets may find useful, they may be 
contributed back to this project.

Provided widgets may change and break in the future. Pinning to a specific
version of this project is recommended.
