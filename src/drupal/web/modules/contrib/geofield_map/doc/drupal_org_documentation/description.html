</ul>

<h3><strong>Basic Installation and Use</strong></h3>
<p>Geofield Map module needs to be installed <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-manage-drupal-site-dependencies" target="_blank">using Composer to manage Drupal site dependencies</a>, which will also download the required <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/geofield" target="_blank">Geofield Module</a> dependency and PHP libraries).</p>
<p>It means simply running the following command from your project root (where the main composer.json file is sited):</p>

<strong>$ composer require 'drupal/geofield_map'</strong>

<p>Once done, you can setup the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Geofield Widget: In a Content Type including a Geofield Field, go to "Manage form display" and select "Geofield Map" as Geofield Widget. Specify the Widget further settings for both Google or Leaflet Map types;</li>
  <li>Geofield Google Map Formatter: In a Content Type including a Geofield Field, go to "Manage display" and select "Geofield Google Map" as Geofield field Formatter.  Specify the Formatter further settings for specific personalization;</li>
  <li>Geofield Map Views: In a View Display select the Geofield Google Map Format, and be sure to add a Geofield type field in the fields list. Specify the View Format settings for specific personalization;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hints for Advanced Use</h4>
<ul>
  <li>For each GeofieldMapWidget it is possible the enable (and custom configure) addresses Geocoding via the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete" target="_blank">Google Maps Places Autocomplete Service</a>.
  </li>
  <li>GeofieldMapWidget uses Leaflet MapTypes/Tiles pre-defined as LeafletTileLayers D8 plugins, but any third party module is able to define and add its new LeafletTileLayer Plugins;</li>
  <li>As default (configurable) option, eventual overlapping markers will be Spiderfied, with the support of the <a href="https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier#overlapping-marker-spiderfier-for-google-maps-api-v3" title="Overlapping Marker Spiderfier Library (for Google Maps)" target="_blank">Overlapping Marker Spiderfier Library (for Google Maps)</a>;</li>
  <li> Add, enable and configure the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/geocoder" target="_blank">Geoocoder module for D8</a> to enable Geocoder Control (with Autocomplete) for quick Address search and Geofield Map Pan & Zoom functionalities;</li>
  <li>The Geofield Map View style plugin will pass to the client js (as drupalSettings.geofield_google_map[mapid] & Drupal.geoFieldMap[mapid] variables) the un-hidden fields values of the View, as markers/features' properties data;</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Geofield Map 2.x Dynamic Markers Theming & Legends Specifications</strong></h3>

<p>Geofield Map 2.x introduces the MapThemer Plugin system that allows the definition of MapThemer Plugins able to dinamically differentiate Map Features/Markers based on Contents Types, Taxonomy Terms, Values, etc.
  Each Plugin Type provides the automatic definition of a related Legend Build, that is able to fill the definition of a Custom GeofieldMapLegend block.</p>

<p>At the moment the following two Geofield Map Themers plugin types have been defined:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Custom Icon Image File, allows the definition of a unique custom Marker Icon, valid for all the Map Markers;</li>
  <li> Entity Type, allows the definition of different Marker Icons based on the View filtered Entity Types/Bundles;</li>
  <li> Taxonomy Term, allows the definition of different Marker Icons based on Taxonomy Terms reference field in View;</li>
  <li> List Type Field, allows the definition of different Marker Icons based on List (Options) Type fields in View;</li>
</ul>

<p>As Drupal 8 Plugin system based, the Geofield MapThemers Plugin and Legend block system is fully extendable and overridable.
  You, as D8 developer, are free to override and extend the existing ones, or create your custom MapThemer based on your specific needs and logics.</p>

<b>New: </b><u>SVG Image files are now supported for Marker Icons, via the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/svg_image">Svg Image module</a></u>

<h4>How to use.</h4>

<p>In a Geofield Map View Display, just go into its settings and choose the wanted MapThemer in the new Map Theming Options section/fieldset.
  It is possible to associate a Drupal Managed File for each MapThemer plugin value and even the Icon Image style the Icon should be rendered on the Map. The Value labels and Icons might have an alias, might be reordered and might be hidden from the correspondent Legend Block.<p>

<p>Once defined and configured the Legend you are free to place it, once or several times, as a normal Drupal 8 block on the pages, with your logics and contextual rules.</p>

<h4><strong>Notes & Warnings</strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Geofield Map module depends from the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/geofield" title="Geofield" target="_blank">Geofield</a> module;</li>
  <li>A unique Gmap Api Key is required for both Google Mapping and Geocoding operations, all performed client-side by js. <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#key-restrictions" target="_blank">It might/should be restricted using the Website Domain / HTTP referrers method</a>;</li>
  <li><b>NEW (!)</b>: The module integrates with the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/geocoder" title="Geocoder" target="_blank">Geocoder</a> module, thus skipping the need of Gmap Api Key for Geocoding operations;</li>
</ul>
