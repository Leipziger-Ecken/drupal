INTRODUCTION
------------

The Remove HTTP headers module removes configured HTTP headers 
from the response. Also removes 
`<meta name="Generator" content="Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)">` 
from the `<head>` tag if the **X-Generator** HTTP header is configured 
to be removed. By default the **X-Generator** and 
**X-Drupal-Dynamic-Cache** HTTP headers are configured to be removed.
