INTRODUCTION
---------------------

This project ships a custom installation profile, modules and themes. All dependencies (+ patches) are managed via Composer. To synchronize core & custom configurations (e.g. content-types, permissions, etc.) we adapt Drupal [Configuration Manager](https://www.drupal.org/docs/configuration-management/managing-your-sites-configuration) to smoothly im- and export system configurations. All configuration files are stored unter *src/drupal/config*. It is highly recommended to install [drush](https://docs.drush.org/en/8.x/install/) for a straightforward developer experience.

Drupal 9 support coming soon. Meanwhile, check support by enabling (and running) the shipped "upgrade_status" module.

A previous version for Drupal 7 was once developed [here](https://github.com/JuliAne/easteasteast).

INSTALLATION
---------------------

Leipziger Ecken can either be run on a regular [LAMP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-ubuntu-18-04)/WAMP-stack or as an "out-of-the-box" solution via [docker](https://www.docker.com/). As a rule of thumb it is recommended to using the former approach when you have no docker-experiences yet.
